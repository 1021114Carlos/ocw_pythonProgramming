# a) count the number of ways to get exactly 3 heads in 10 flips of a coin.

# b) for a fair coin, what is the probability of exacly 3 heads in 10 flips.
# n!/k!(n-k)

# Question 1

# Question 2

How many sequences of 6 nucleotides can be made using any of the 4 nucleotides A, C, G, T at each place of the sequence?

(You can give your answer using notation like 2*(3^4).)
# The answer is 4^6
print(4**6)

# Question 3: 
# Suppose a sequence of 8 nucleotides contains 4A's, 2C's, G, T. How many such
# sequences are there?
