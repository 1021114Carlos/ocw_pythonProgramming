# deck of 52 cards
# Game is poker.
# 13 Ranks: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A
# 4 Suites: Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Treble

# How many different 5 card hand have exactly one pair?
# one pair and then 3 cards. so from 5 choose 5
# then from 52 choose 5 SO THIS PROCESS IS FLAWED.

# Second attempt. 

# there are 13 ranks and i will choose one. Order does not matter.
# then, from 4 suites, choose one. 
# then all the other ranks. choose 3 out of 12
# finally, 4^3

# This is a combination problem. k!/(n-k)!
# a = (math.comb(13, 1)*math.comb(4, 2)*math.comb(12, 3)*(4**3))
# print(a)

# What is the probability of getting a one-pair poker hand
# first let's choose 5 cards out of 52. Then divide a/b?
# b = (math.comb(52, 5))
# print(b)
# print(round((a/b), 5))

# S = {H, T}
# H disjoint T^c
# coin toss: .5 heads: .5 tails

# print(math.comb(52, 5))

# Problem 2: (inclusion-exclusion rule)

# 50 zebras. 20 females (F), 25 have no stripes (NS). 
# What is the range of possible values for p = P(F union NS)?
