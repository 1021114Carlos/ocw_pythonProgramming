# 5*(5-1)*(5-2)*(5-3)*(5-4) which is equivalent to 5*4*3*2*1 then 
# we observe that the argument inside the function is subtracted by one
# everytime the base case is not met.
# Once the base case is met, the argument inside the function initiates 
# the recursive process and multiplies the result of the argument 
# inside the function agains the previous result.
